🌟 Dynamic Quote Generator App

This is a Dynamic Quote Generator App — a project built as part of the “DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data” module in the ALX Front-End Development program.

This interactive web application dynamically generates, manages, and filters quotes based on user interactions. It’s designed to strengthen your understanding of advanced DOM manipulation, web storage, and JSON data handling — key skills for modern front-end developers.

🚀 Project Overview

The Dynamic Quote Generator App allows users to:

Generate random motivational or custom quotes dynamically.

Save favorite quotes to Local Storage or Session Storage for persistence.

Import and export JSON data to manage quote collections.

Filter quotes by category, author, or user-defined criteria.

Sync local data with a mock server and resolve potential data conflicts.

By the end of this project, I should have built a fully interactive and persistent web application using pure JavaScript and modern browser APIs.

🎯 Learning Objectives
🧠 Utilize Advanced DOM Manipulation Techniques

Dynamically create and modify HTML elements using JavaScript.

Implement event-driven programming to enhance interactivity.

💾 Implement and Use Web Storage

Persist data using Local Storage and Session Storage.

Write functions to save, retrieve, and manage stored quotes seamlessly.

🔄 Handle JSON Data

Import and export quote collections as JSON files.

Manage JSON data effectively within the app while maintaining consistency and integrity.

🔍 Filter and Sync Data
